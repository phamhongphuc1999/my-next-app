This allows users to regain access if the key is lost, but it does not protect against theft or leakage. For example, storing the key on offline devices (e.g., USB drives), even encrypted keys requires managing an additional Key Encryption Key (KEK); devices can also be lost or damaged.'

This distributed backup strategy improves both security and fault tolerance, enabling more flexible recovery mechanisms. One example is Shamir's Secret Sharing, which divides the private key or recovery data into several shares, with a required threshold of shares to recover the account. These shares can be stored as passkeys on the user's device or as encrypted keys in the cloud."

          eliminates the need for external guardians but still uses smart contracts. A famous method
          is KELP
          <RefLink toId="kelp" mode="cite" />, the method has four function logics: (1) commit, (2)
          reveal, (3) claim, and (4) challenge. This approach is fully on-chain, trustless, and
          setup-free, making it ideal for decentralized key management. However, it depends on the
          owner's ability to monitor and respond to unauthorized recovery attempts in time.
