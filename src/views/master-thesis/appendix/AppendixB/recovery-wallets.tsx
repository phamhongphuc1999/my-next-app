            The guardian-based solution in Clave allows email accounts, rather than traditional web3
            addresses, to act as guardians. This is made possible through the use of zkEmail
            <RefLink toId="zk-email" mode="cite" />, which enables zero-knowledge proofs to verify
            email ownership without revealing the guardian's email address or content.
