Web3, the next phase of the internet, is based on blockchain technology, cryptographic technology, and peer-to-peer networks. Its goal is to create a decentralized internet with open, transparent websites and web applications. Web3 creates decentralized, trustless, and transparent systems. Therefore, Web3 gains numerous benefits for individuals.'

They can choose what information to share with companies and third parties. In addition, the decentralized Web allows users to track their data and review the source code of their platforms. All stakeholders remain aware of the value and transactions they are involved. In addition, Web3 directly connects businesses with customers, significantly reducing or eliminating middle layers.'

        With the potential to revolutionize finance, supply chains, and digital asset transactions,
        effective digital asset management is important. Blockchain wallets address the need by
        securely storing users' public and private keys while providing an intuitive interface for
        managing crypto assets. A wallet allows users to track their assets, create transactions,
        and interact with decentralized applications (dApps). The role of wallets in the Web3
        ecosystem is important. Considering the advantages and disadvantages of the most common
        wallet type, Externally Owned Accounts (EOAs), this thesis proposes a novel blockchain
        wallet mechanism and discusses its potential improvements.
