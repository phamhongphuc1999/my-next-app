        The account system is fundamental to blockchain's functionality, enabling users and
        applications to interact with decentralized ledgers. Unlike traditional systems, where
        accounts are typically maintained and managed by centralized authorities, blockchain
        accounts are decentralized and governed by a cryptographic algorithm. In the current
        blockchain architecture, user accounts are divided into two typical types: externally owned
        accounts (EOAs) and contract accounts (CAs). EOAs are the most basic type of blockchain
        account, allowing users to execute transactions, such as cryptocurrency transfers or smart
        contract executions. CAs allow users to perform complex operations, such as Uniswap's
        automated makers or Aave's lending protocols.

      <AppArticle isFirst>
        EOAs are controlled through a cryptographic key pair consisting of a private key and a
        public key. The private key is used to generate digital signatures and authorize
        transactions, while the public key is used to derive the account's address. Because EOAs are
        based on a cryptographic pair key, their applications are limited to signing transactions
        and interacting with the smart contract, and can not store executable logic,
        transactions'state, or perform complex programmable actions.{' '}

        CAs are controlled by on-chain code (implemented by a smart contract) rather than a private
        key. CAs cannot initiate transactions on their own but can be triggered by transactions sent
        from EOAs or other contracts. When triggered, a CA executes its embedded logic, enabling
        advanced functionalities such as automated market making, lending protocols, multi-signature
        wallets, or programmable access controls. A contract account consists of key components (as
