        A smart contract is a decentralized, trustless, self-executing program stored on a
        blockchain that automatically executes the shared code when predefined conditions are met.
        The concept was first proposed by Nick Szabo in 1997{' '}
        <RefLink mode="cite" toId="smart-contract" />, who considers smart contracts as digital
        protocols that execute agreements with minimal trust. Szabo's idea leveraged cryptographic
        techniques to ensure security and automation, but lacked a practical implementation platform
        at the time.

        Smart contracts came with Ethereum's launch in 2015, introduced by Vitalik Buterin{' '}
        <RefLink mode="cite" toId="ethereum-whitepaper" />. Ethereum introduced the Ethereum Virtual
        Machine (EVM), a Turing-complete environment that allows developers to deploy and execute
        arbitrary logic on-chain or smart contracts. Since then, other platforms such as Cardano,
        Solana, and Binance Smart Chain have installed smart contracts. Fundamentally, a smart
        contract consists of three core components:

The EVM is a Turing-complete virtual machine, which means that EVM can solve any problems with a necessary time, energy, and instructions. One of the key features of the EVM is its determinism, which is that the same input always results in the same output. Additionally, the EVM is designed to be isolated from the host system, meaning that smart contracts run in a sandboxed environment, isolated from the host machine.'

        The structure and operating mechanism of smart contracts are illustrated in{' '}
        <RefLink toId="smart-contract-structure" />. A smart contract is written in a high-level
        programming language; in the scope of this thesis, it is Solidity. The source code is then
        compiled into EVM bytecode, a low-level binary representation that the EVM can interpret and
        execute. This bytecode is sent to the blockchain based on a deployment transaction to
        blockchain. After being verified and included in a block, the contract is officially
        deployed and then is assigned a unique address. From that point, users and other contracts
        can trigger functions within the contract by sending transactions to its address, executing
        the smart contract logic, and changing its storage.
      </AppArticle>
      <AppArticle>
        {
          "When a user or another contract initiates a transaction directed to a deployed smart contract's address, the EVM retrieves the bytecode of the target smart contract from the blockchain state. The bytecode is then interpreted as instructions or opcodes such as ADD, MUL, JUMP, CALL, SSTORE, RETURN. As a stack-based virtual machine, the EVM executes these operations using a last-in, first-out (LIFO) stack structure, where instructions are pushed to and popped from the stack during computation. If the execution completes successfully, the contract's persistent storage may be updated, and the global blockchain state is modified accordingly to reflect token transfers, state variable changes, or other effects resulting from the contract's logic."

Automation means that once deployed, smart contracts execute autonomously when a predefined condition is met. Immutability is that the contract's code can not be changed after deployed. Transparency means that the code and state are publicly visible on the blockchain (in public networks), allowing anyone to verify functionality."
