Its advantages include ease of implementation, user-friendly experience, and reliability in typical scenarios. However, EOAs still present several limitations that lead to significant challenges. These include key management risks, feature limitations, security vulnerabilities, contract account limitations, lack of native account recovery, and inflexibility in access control. Among these, there are three primary challenges, including key management risks, feature limitations, and security vulnerabilities. Addressing these core issues can potentially resolve the others. For example, limitations in contract accounts are an aspect of feature limitations, and the lack of native account recovery can be dealt with by handling feature limitations.'

Unlike smart contracts, EOAs cannot execute or implement programmable logic. Various recovery methods have been proposed, such as off-chain backups and seed phrases, but these approaches require users to securely store recovery credentials or rely on trusted storage solutions. Pre-signed transactions can add an extra layer of security; however, they still depend on offline storage devices and secondary accounts. More advanced recovery solutions—both guardian-based and guardian-less—are implemented via smart contracts and, therefore, cannot be natively supported by EOAs without external modifications.'

For example, a brute-force attack has a complexity of $O(n)$, while Pollard's Rho algorithm has a complexity of $O(\\sqrt{n})$. Even if a computer could perform $10^{12}$ operations per second, the time required to compute a 256-bit private key would be approximately $10^{25}$ seconds, making elliptic curve cryptography highly secure against direct attacks."
