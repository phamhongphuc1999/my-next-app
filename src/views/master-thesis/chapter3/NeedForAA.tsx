          "illustrates the basic account abstraction structure. At its core, AA separates an account's identity (the public key and private key) from its logic. AA still maintains the user control through a key pair. However, the user's logic and state are managed on-chain by a contract account that is associated with the EOA instead of the key pair directly. For example, in the traditional EOA model, a wallet validates transactions at the protocol level using hardcoded rules, typically elliptic curve cryptography. With account abstraction, this validation logic is moved on-chain and becomes programmable. The mechanism eliminates EOA's single-point failure, ensuring the user's funds are safe when the private key is compromised through the implementation of recovery methods."

          'Account abstraction provides several advantages over traditional account models, particularly in the context of security, usability, and programmability. Developers can upgrade the logic of smart contract wallets to add new features or repair vulnerabilities, something that is not possible with fixed-function in EOAs. For example, a major limitation of EOAs is their inefficiency in executing multiple transactions. Each transaction must be signed and executed individually, leading to a slow user experience.'

        AA can improve this by allowing transaction batching. Instead of executing multiple
        transactions separately, AA allows users to bundle multiple operations into a single
        transaction. As shown in <RefLink toId="multicall" />, EOAs execute transactions
        sequentially, while <RefLink toId="multicall1" /> illustrates how AA bundles multiple
        transactions in one, reducing execution time and improving efficiency.
