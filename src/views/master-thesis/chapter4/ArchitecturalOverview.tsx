Overall, users interact with the system through a user interface, which constructs UserOperations according to ERC-4337. The UserOperations is then sent to a bundler. The bundler stores UserOperations in the alternative mempool and uses internal services to batch, validate, and submit valid UserOperations to EntryPoint contract.'
