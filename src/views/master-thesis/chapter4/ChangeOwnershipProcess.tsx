        The final action supported by the guardian mechanism is the change of ownership, as
        illustrated in <RefLink toId="the-change-ownership-process" />. This process is divided into
        three steps:

        The proposed design uses ZKPs to overcome the limitations of the traditional approach. The
        smart contract stores the hash of each guardian's address instead of the plaintext address.
        Each guardian independently creates and submits their proof on-chain. The proof creation and
        verification process (referred to as the confirm change owner process, represented by the
        green square in <RefLink toId="the-change-ownership-process" /> is discussed in detail in{' '}
        <RefLink toId="zkp-based-guardian-mechanism" mode="section" />. The smart contract verifies
        each proof and records its validity. Once the number of valid confirmations reaches the
        required threshold, the smart contract unlocks the ownership change function.
