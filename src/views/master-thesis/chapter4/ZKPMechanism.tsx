However, verifying a guardian's authorization by comparing a submitted hash with a stored hash is not sufficient because everyone has access to the guardian's address, and they can compute the hash of the guardian's address. Even if they are equal, we cannot be certain that the sender actually controls the corresponding guardian account."

        To ensure the verification does not reveal any information about the guardians, the process
        is implemented through ZKPs (the dashed rectangle in{' '}
        <RefLink toId="overall-confirm-change-owner-process" />
        ). By using ZKPs, the on-chain phase only needs to verify the proof, that is not reveal data
        about guardians.

          "The proof must include the guardian's address. This requirement exists for two reasons. First, the smart contract must compare the hash from the submitted proof to the hashes it stores to ensure that the guardian is an authorized guardian. Since the ZKP protocol does not have access to the list of hashes stored in the smart contract, the hash must be submitted to the contract. Second, the guardian's address should not be submitted directly to the smart contract without going through the ZKP protocol. If a guardian's address is compromised, an attacker could submit the guardian's address hash along with their own signature, which would be a valid signature but from an invalid guardian, to the smart contract. Based on the above argument, the proposed ZKP protocol must have three characteristics:"
