        The ZKGuardian smart contract (as shown in{' '}
        <RefLink toId="zk-guardian-core" mode="program" />) provides the core logic for the recovery
        process. Its interface includes functions for submitting and confirming a new owner address
        via a zk-SNARK proof, as well as for managing the guardian set. The verification of proofs
        uses public signals to ensure that only valid, authorized requests are accepted. The
        contract supports guardian setup, threshold configuration, and dynamic management of the
        guardian list.
