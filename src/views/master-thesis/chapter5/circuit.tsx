        We use circomlib <RefLink toId="circomlib" mode="cite" />, a library that provides a
        collection of cryptographic circuits and helper functions specifically designed for use with
        zk-SNARKs and zk-STARKs, as a tool to build our circuit.

It produces three outputs: hashPublicKey, increment, and address. These correspond to the hashed guardian account address, the increment value, and the new owner address extracted from the 256-bit message signed by the guardian.'

        To compile and integrate the circuit with a smart contract, we use circom and snarkjs{' '}
        <RefLink toId="snarkjs" mode="cite" />. First, the circuit is compiled into a WebAssembly
        file (.wasm) and a constraint file (.r1cs). The witness-calculator program uses secret data,
        containing the input file and WebAssembly, to generate a witness. The snarkjs tool compiles
        the constraints and witnesses to a Solidity file, enabling smart contracts to validate ZKPs
        (as illustrated in <RefLink toId="architecture-circom-and-snarkjs" />
        ). The compilation and integration process are discussed in more detail in{' '}
        <RefLink toId="circom" mode="section" />.
