Similar to the proposed wallet in this thesis, guardians in Soul Wallet only participate when the owner initiates a change to a new address.

        <RefLink toId="common-recovery-process" /> shows the common recovery process used by Soul
        wallet and the proposed wallet. Both wallets divide the recovery process into three steps,
        with several differences:

          {
            ': In both Soul Wallet and the proposed wallet, guardians perform the recovery process by submitting proof or a signature. Specifically, in the proposed wallet, guardians submit zero-knowledge proofs, whereas in Soul Wallet, they provide signatures. Once the threshold is met, both wallets unlock a function that allows the owner address to be changed.'
          }
          <AppArticle>
            An important difference is how guardian identities are handled during this process. In
            Soul Wallet, guardians must reveal their raw addresses (as shown in Program{' '}
            <RefLink toId="schedule-a-recovery-operation" mode="program" />, where the rawGuardian
            parameter and signature are used to verify their identity). This approach exposes
            guardian information on-chain, which can potentially be linked to the owner through
            external analysis. In contrast, the proposed wallet hides guardian identities by using
            ZKP, ensuring that guardian identities remain hidden even during the recovery process.
