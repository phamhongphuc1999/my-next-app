        A Quadratic Arithmetic Program (QAP) is a polynomial-based representation of an arithmetic
        circuit, particularly the R1CS. The use of polynomials in QAP is chosen by two key
        properties for constructing zk-SNARKs.

Given two different polynomials $P_1$ and $P_2$, even if with very few different coefficients, they have very different curve forms. Therefore, the probability that $P_1(s) = P_2(s)$, where a random $s \\in \\mathbb{F}_p$, is very low.'
