        Among these components, <span className="font-[500]">Homomorphic Hiding (HH)</span> plays a

      <ArticleBox>
        An HH, denoted as <span className="italic">E(x)</span>, is a function applied to a number x
        x that satisfies the following properties:
      </ArticleBox>
      <ArticleBox mode="div">
        <ArticleBox>
          1. For most values of x, given <span className="italic">E(x)</span>, it is difficult to
          recover x.
        </ArticleBox>
        <ArticleBox isMath={true}>
          2. Different inputs lead to different outputsâ€”so if {'$x \\neq y$'}, then{' '}
          {'$ E(x) \\neq E(y) $'}
